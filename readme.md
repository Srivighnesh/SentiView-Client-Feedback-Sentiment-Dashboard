SentiView: Client Feedback Sentiment Analysis Dashboard 

A full-stack prototype application designed to collect, analyze, and visualize client feedback using sentiment analysis. This system transforms unstructured text feedback into meaningful insights to support data-driven decision-making for delivery teams and project managers. 

 

📌 Overview 

In software service companies, understanding client sentiment is essential for: 

Project success 

Early issue detection 

Client retention 

Feedback often comes in unstructured forms—emails, surveys, chat logs—making manual analysis time-consuming and inconsistent.\ SentiView addresses this challenge by automating the process of extracting, classifying, and visualizing sentiment from client feedback. 

Key Benefits 

Convert qualitative feedback into quantifiable metrics 

Gain insights for better decision-making 

Track client satisfaction trends 

Identify early warnings and issues 

 

🎯 Scope and Objectives 

Primary Goal 

Develop a working prototype of a Client Feedback Sentiment Analysis Dashboard capable of collecting, analyzing, and visualizing client feedback to provide actionable insights. 

Specific Objectives 

Build a full-stack application for ingesting and processing client feedback data. 

Implement a sentiment analysis model to classify feedback into positive, neutral, and negative categories. 

Develop a user-friendly dashboard to visualize sentiment trends and key insights.
