3. Project Overview
In software service companies, understanding client sentiment is essential for project success, early issue detection, and client retention. Feedback often comes in unstructured forms—emails, surveys, chat logs—making manual analysis time-consuming and inconsistent.
SentiView addresses this challenge by automating the process of extracting, classifying, and visualizing sentiment from client feedback.
This prototype helps teams:
•	Convert qualitative feedback into quantifiable metrics
•	Gain insights for better decision-making
•	Track client satisfaction trends
•	Identify early warnings and issues
